## Formatting the text

To format text with italic it's needed to frame it by asterisk (*) or underscores (_). For example, *like this* or _like this_.

To format text with bold it's needed to frame it with double asterisk (**) or double underscores (__) For example, **like this** or __like this__.

Alternative ways of formatting the text are needed to combine the both ways. For example, _text can be formatted with italic and with **bold** at the same time_.
