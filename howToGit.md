# Git Instruction

## Some commands, using in work with Git:


* Creating of repository:
```sh
git init
```

* The git add command is used for staging changes in Git prior to committing them to the current branch:
```sh
git add <file_name>
```

* Commit creating:
```sh
git commit -m 'Some commit'
```

* The command using to see the status of working directory:
```sh
git status
```
* We have to enter this command into the terminal to see the list of created commits:
```sh
git log 
```
* Or we can use this command to see it in abbreviated form:
```sh
git log --oneline
```
* This command will be useful if we want to go to another branch of project (another version):
```sh
git checkout <the number of commit>
```
* We will use this command if we wanna go to the master branch:
```sh
git checkout master
```

* And this command will be useful if we want to compare changes commited in Git:
```sh
git diff
```
## Remote repositories

* Firstly we have to create an account on the GitHub
* The command used to take the copy of remote repository is:
```sh
git clone <the link from the git hub, that we copied there>
```

* The command we use to copy changes from the web browser:
```sh
git pull
```
* The command we use to upload the local changes to the remote repository on the Git Hub, that we are working with:
```sh
git push
```

* If we want to make a copy of the repository in our profile on the GitHub, we have to do Fork where we want to


* Then we have to create one more branch and to do all the changes only there

* After our work is finished we can do the push to our account and then pull request with offered changes
